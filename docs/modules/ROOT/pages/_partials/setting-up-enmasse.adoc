// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='doing-procedure-a']

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
