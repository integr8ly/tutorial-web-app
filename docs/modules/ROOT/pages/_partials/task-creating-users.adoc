// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='doing-procedure-a']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='creating-users_{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

To create users:

. Log in to the link:{sso-admin-url}[RH SSO Admin Console, window="_blank"].
. Click on `Users` in the left menu bar.
. Click the `Add User` button on the right hand side of the page. 
. Enter details for that user.
+
The only required field is `Username`.  
. Click save.  This will bring you to the management page for your new user.

. To ensure the user has all services available to them when they log in:
.. Open a new browser window in incognito/private mode.
.. Log into this application using the credentials of the new user you created.
+
The system will start provisioning all the services required in minutes, and these will be available to the user when they log in.
