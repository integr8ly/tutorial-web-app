// This assembly is included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Save the context of the assembly that is including this one.
// This is necessary for including assemblies in assemblies.
// See also the complementary step on the last line of this file.

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='my-assembly-a']
// * Title: = My assembly A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='creating-connections']
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules-{context}'].

= Creating connections

//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
:context: assembly-keyword
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
