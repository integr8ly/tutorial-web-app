:enmasse: Red Hat AMQ Online

== What will I accomplish?

In a multi-application system, you often find:

* communication between the applications can be difficult due to differing technologies
* custom solutions can be difficult to create and maintain
* custom solutions require custom monitoring
* understanding the relationship between the applications requires deep technical insight to the overall architecture

A more structured approach involves:

* a simple integration that developers can understand intuitively
* simple provisioning and configuration
* built-in monitoring

This walkthrough describes how  to create such an integration, using OpenShift, Red Hat AMQ Online and API connectors in Fuse.
