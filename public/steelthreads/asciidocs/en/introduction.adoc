.Introduction

In this tutorial you create two apps using Launcher (a Node.js app and a Spring Boot app).
Each app exposes a RESTful API that you connect so that they can share data without requiring coding or custom configuration.
This integration can be provisioned in minutes and is easily monitored and maintained using OpenShift, EnMasse and Fuse.

.Prerequisites

* [x] Access to an OpenShift instance with Integreatly components installed
